EVTDESC201083;Copper seals with a script—could this be a form of writing? Satisfyingly, our archaeologists have uncovered an entire archive of ancient tablets during their latest expedition.

EVTDESC201086;Scientific research and aerial surveys leave no doubt: the Indus Valley, once shrouded in mystery, is now a cornerstone of modern archaeology. Excavations have uncovered vast cities with advanced drainage systems, great public baths, and archives filled with inscribed seals and tablets. But the most prestigious discovery was made by a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist, who found evidence that the so-called "Great Bath of Mohenjo-Daro" may have held deep religious significance. This discovery reshapes our understanding of the Harappan civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
